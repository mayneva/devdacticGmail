Anna had some problems with submitting her app in GitHub ("VS Code has 10.000 files that need to be commit").  This problem arose due to the fact that the hidden .git folder was in the root directory  (C:\Users\USER_NAME\) and VSCode suggested sending all updates from the root directory to Git.  After she created the .gitignor file in the root directory and moved the hidden folder .git to the project folder, she could manage to push the app files in Git.
